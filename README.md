#### 👋 Introduction
Welcome to **Stumpin' Stones**! In this video game, you control a stone cube called the <img src="assets/admintile.png" width="25"> Admin Cube. It lives in the flat world of Tile Land. 
It has the power to move two <img src="assets/bluestatuetile.png" width="25"> <img src="assets/redstatuetile.png" width="25"> Stone Statues of two colors in the same and opposite direction of its own movement.
Move the Stone Statues to their color-respective Destination tiles to progress to the next level.
#### 🖐️ How To Interact
* 🖱️ Click on the Admin Cube tile to show its possible moves.
* 🚶 Click on one of its adjacent <img src="assets/adminmovetile.png" width="25"> blue-tinted clones to move the Admin Cube to that tile.
#### 🧩 The Fundamentals
